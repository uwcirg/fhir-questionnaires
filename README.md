# fhir-questionnaires
A repository of FHIR Questionnaires in json format. This is intended to be a temporary repository so we can refine them prior to committing them to FHIR repositories.

# Fields and how we use them
- "id"
   - usage: this is how we refer to the questionnaire in code, CarePlans, etc.
   - REQUIRED (same as standard), and we need it to be a known & reliable value (not assigned by the FHIR server) - that part is not per standard.
   - example: "CIRG-PHQ9"
   - Our profile: add the above info
- "title"
   - usage: human friendly.
   - REQUIRED (1..1). THIS IS A CHANGE FROM THE STANDARD, which says 0..1. Add this to our profile.
   - example: "Everyday Cognition - Participant Self Report Form [ECog]"
   - In our [questionnaire filler](https://github.com/uwcirg/asbi-screening-app), this is used for the page's <head><title>.
- "description"
   - Spec says: "Natural language description of the questionnaire", 0..1, Markdown.
   - Contrast this with item[0]._text.extension (see below), which we use to describe the questionnaire in XHTML for rendering on web pages.
   - Amy do you use this anywhere? It seems not (I don't see it in the questionnaire filler's DCW Questionnaires, at least), but I may be missing something. If you're not using it, then I'll reserve it for descriptive text that we don't intend to render. 
- "code"
   - usage: uniquely identify the questionnaire according to some system, eg at LOINC. Not our canonical reference (see "id"). See https://github.com/uwcirg/fhir-questionnaires/pull/2/files#r974579864
- "name"
   - Standard says 0..1; computer friendly.
   - Do we use this anywhere Amy? I see that it's populated for the DCW Questionnaires.
- "linkId"
   - usage: QuestionnaireResponse will refer to this
   - REQUIRED (1..1), same as standard.
- "status"
   - REQUIRED (1..1), same as standard.
   - Default for us: "active"
   - We don't read this for anything, and have populated it inconsistently.
- "item"[n]
  - item[n].text - used in the UI.
  - item[n].code.display - ignore, same as item.text but from external source. No need to remove, often too laborious.
  - item[n].linkId
     - QuestionnaireResponse refers to this (for dhair2 this is questions.fhir_linkId)
     - REQUIRED.
  - item[n].type
     - example: "choice", "decimal", "string", "display"
     - REQUIRED.
     - Note: we ignore other directives eg item.extension.valueCodeableConcept.coding.code "drop-down".  
  - item[n].answerOption[n]
    - item.answerOption[n].valueCoding
      - code: QuestionnaireResponse refers to this (for dhair2 this is options.fhir_code)
      - display: the text displayed for the option.
    - item.answerOption[n].extension
      - "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/ordinalValue"
        - almost always valueDecimal; rarely valueString (example [here](https://github.com/uwcirg/asbi-screening-app/blob/master/src/fhir/1_Questionnaire-C-IDAS.json)).
      - "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-optionPrefix" I see this is nearly always populated, but Amy do you use this at all? Seems redundant w/ ordinalValue (just above).
  - item[n]._text.extension where item[n].type = "display"
    - XTHML displayed...
      - ... during the questionnaire, usually instructions.
      - ... in the [summary report](https://github.com/uwcirg/patient-summary) "about" pop-up.
      - Not a question (does not have an answerOption[]).
      - Usually at item[0] (the screener gives it its own page in this case)
      - Sometimes later as instructions for a specific question item
      - Examples of both in [MINICOG in the questionnaire filler](https://github.com/uwcirg/asbi-screening-app/blob/master/src/fhir/1_Questionnaire-MINICOG.json).
    - "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/rendering-xhtml"
    - "valueString": XTHML
    - Examples
      - CIRG-PC-PTSD-5.json
      - CIRG-PHQ-4.json
      - 1_Questionnaire-USAUDIT.json (screener app)
  - item[n]."extension"."valueCoding"
    - We sometimes use this to indicate that an item is a score [here](https://github.com/uwcirg/fhir-questionnaires/pull/2/files#diff-66fd6a93556a044e8ffa3a290dac3e49b37b29b60c0cdddfb2645fe5cea49ae2R582)
    - Amy do you read this for anything?
  - item[n]."enableWhen"
    - Amy you're not using this for anything, are you? I see it for the DCW Audit questionnaires, but we don't use those...

**We'll continue to curate this as need be**
